```python
series_sum = 0.0
num_terms = 10000

for i in range(num_terms):
    denominator = 2 * i + 1
    term = 1.0 / denominator
    if i % 2 == 1:  # Odd terms are subtracted
        series_sum -= term
    else:  # Even terms are added
        series_sum += term

final_result = series_sum * 4
print(f"The sum of the first {num_terms} terms multiplied by 4 is: {final_result}")
```
Output:
The sum of the first 10000 terms multiplied by 4 is: 3.1414926535900345
